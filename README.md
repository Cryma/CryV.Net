# CryV.Net

CryV<x>.Net was intended to provide an alternative Grand Theft Auto V multiplayer experience, which could be completely customized.

This project is based on my abandoned CryV library, which handled the integration of various Grand Theft Auto V functionalities and the hooking itself. As CryV is **not public**, this library **cannot be used** and only serves as an _illustration_.
